This codebook describes the structure and orgins of the variables contained in 
the file avgVarGrouped.txt and also explains the companion file 
avgVarGrouped_Dict.txt.

avgVarGrouped.txt and the file <avgVarGrouped_Dict.txt> are the result of a data extract and cleaning script called run_analysis.R. This R script does the following steps:

1. Downloads the file <https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip> into the working directory
2. Unpacks the file into a directory called 'UCI HAR Dataset' in the working directory
3. The 'UCI HAR Dataset' directory contains a number of files relating to the data collected for 'Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones' experiment conducted by the following 
	Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz, Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto.
	Smartlab - Non Linear Complex Systems Laboratory
	DITEN - Universit√† degli Studi di Genova.
	Via Opera Pia 11A, I-16145, Genoa, Italy.
	activityrecognition@smartlab.ws
	www.smartlab.ws
The directory contains both 'test' and 'train' data in seperate sub-directories
4. The script assembles a data file from each of the 'train' and 'test' locations, and then combines the files into a tidy data set called avgVarGrouped.txt
